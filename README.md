# 🚀 CryptoCoin Chaos: How I Learned Android Dev (and Almost Became a Crypto Billionaire)

## 🤪 Welcome to the Wildest Coding Adventure Ever!

Buckle up, fellow code warriors! This is NOT your typical cryptocurrency wallet app. This is what happens when a developer decides to learn Android development and accidentally builds something that might actually work... maybe... possibly?

## 🧩 Modularization: Because Sanity is Overrated

I've broken this app into so many modules, my computer thinks I'm having an existential crisis:
- `app`: The grand conductor of this circus 🎪
- `core`: Where the magic (and bugs) happen ✨
- `feature:wallet`: Crypto dreams live here 💸
- `feature:transaction`: Moving money faster than my bank allows 💨
- `feature:authentication`: Keeping the crypto gremlins out 🔒

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (aka My Survival Kit)

- **Language**: Kotlin (because Java was too mainstream)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with a sprinkle of "please work"
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt (sounds like a superhero, works like magic)
- **Async Programming**: Coroutines (aka digital spaghetti code)

## 🚀 How to Survive This Project

1. Clone the repo (or download the chaos)
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Pray to the coding gods
4. Press run
5. Consume industrial quantities of coffee ☕

## 🐛 Bug Reporting
